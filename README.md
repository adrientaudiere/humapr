# humapr

With this package, we want to provide a simple tool to visualise human topographic data. Although an early and simple version, it should be fully functional. We're currently preparing the package for CRAN submission, but invite you to go ahead and try it out. We're very keen to get feedback and bug reports from useRs, just as suggestions for improvements are very welcome!
