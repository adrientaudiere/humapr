# humapr

With this package, we want to provide a simple tool to visualise human topographic data as choropleths. humapr is still simple but fully functional, and handles both tidy data (one row = one observation) and aggregated data (one row = one summary statistic, e.g. mean or sum). Although an early and simple version, it should be fully functional. We will submit the package to CRAN eventually, but wanted to collect experiences and feedback from the community first, to have a more rounded package to submit.

Thus, we invite you to go ahead and put it to the test. We're very keen to get feedback and bug reports from useRs. If you have ideas for other geoms, feel free to throw us an email or added it under issues here on the GitHub page. 

An example of one-way tabulated (simulated!) data, with annotations:

Another example of two-way tabulated (simulated!) data, without annotations:
