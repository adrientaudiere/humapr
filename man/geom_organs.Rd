\title{Add organs map to your \code{humap}}
\usage{
geom_organs(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, annotate = "freq",
  bridge_loc = NULL, combine = NULL, controls = NULL,
  na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = FALSE, inherit.aes = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{\code{aes()} object, just like other \code{ggplot2} functions, with two aesthetics: \code{loc} is the
name of the data frame column containing localisation codes for observations; and \code{side} the column holding
the laterality data (must be either "left" or "right, but see \code{bridge_side}). In the future, we'll probably
add a third aesthetic to allow the fill reflect other things than merely tabulation counts.}

\item{data}{tidy data frame, like the type you'd feed into \code{ggplot()} when producing a histogram.}

\item{annotate}{\code{"freq"} (defaults) shows only absolute and relative frequencies, \code{"all"} includes region
names, and \code{NA} omits labels altogether. See Details for ways to fine-tune the apperance of annotations.}

\item{bridge_loc}{named \emph{list} specifying the bridge from your data format to the native format of
\code{geom_body}, e.g., \code{list(head = c("head", "face", "scalp"))}. See Details.}

\item{combine}{named \emph{list} of vectors naming the regions to be combined and mapped as one, e.g., \code{list(arm
= c("shoulder", "arm", "elbow", "wrist"))}. See Details for behaviour.}

\item{controls}{named \emph{list} of more specific parameters for fine-tuning the appereance of the humap. Currently,
these controls are available (more will follow in the future):
\itemize{
  \item \code{na_fill}:  should be a string or function specifying the fill of zero-count regions (default: "black")
  \item \code{label_pad}: a numeric defining the padding between labels, in percent of map height (default: \code{3.5})
  \item \code{mid_include}: a logical defining whether to include mid-line observations and split them equally between left and right (default: \code{FALSE})
  \item \code{round_counts}: a logical indicating whether to round (up) half-counts in annotation labels when splitting mid-line observations between left and right (default: \code{FALSE})
}}

\item{na.rm}{logical indicating whether to remove missing data. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{show.legend}{passed on to the underlying machinery of the \code{geom}.}

\item{inherit.aes}{passed on to the underlying machinery of the \code{geom}.}

\item{...}{passed on to the underlying machinery of the \code{geom}.}
}
\value{
A layer object to a \code{humap} object.
}
\description{
Use this function to draw a choropleth on the internal organs of a human. The \code{bridge_loc}, \code{combine} and
\code{controls} arguments behave as for \code{\link{geom_body}}, so go to its Details section for more on how to use
these.
}
\details{
The polygons in this geom overlap, so you can give them outlines with \code{colour} and \code{size} (just as you do
for, i.a., histogram and ribbon geoms) to make them easier to distinguish. By default, there is no outline.
